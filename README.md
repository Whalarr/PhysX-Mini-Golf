# PhysX Mini Golf
 A mini golf simulation using the Nvidia PhysX API and C++.
 
 This was produced during my time at university to explore physics simulations. Our task was to create a miniature golf course that incorporated physics-based elements including custom materials and physics materials.
 
 Note: This runs off the Nvidia PhysX API which needs installing for this game to be playable. To run the game, given that you have the API, open up the solution file, and run tutorial 4 to play the golf game.
